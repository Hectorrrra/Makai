# Makai

# Makai Rentals is a web application that facilitates the process of renting water sport equipment at designated stations.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the blogs admin form as well as the stands form I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend for blogs while with stands I just took care for the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities. Makai is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

● Implemented content management for Blogs. Providing the user with ability to sort, filter, paginate & manage
their blog content.

● Developed a form using React and Formik to create blog posts and new stands with validation and error handling.

● Created the necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination.

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.

● Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality.

● Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks with team members to ensure cohesive implementation of code.
